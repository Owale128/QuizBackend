# Quiz Game (React) ðŸ˜ƒ

This code is a backend application written in Node.js using the Express framework. It handles submission and retrieval of user results for a quiz-like application and uses a MongoDB database to store user data. When the server starts, it connects to the database and sets up two main routes: one to handle the submission of user scores and one to retrieve the highest scores. The database model defines for users, and a separate file contains configurations to connect to the database. In summary, this code allows user results to be saved and retrieved from a MongoDB database for a quiz application through a simple REST API
